AMPize offers a graphical interface to manage digital assets which came from your data sources or allows you to upload your own images.
Moreover this interface allows you to choose an image for all image type fields.

## Launching the image library

You can access the image library from 2 locations: "globally" from the burger menu or in an "image field".

### Globally

<amp-img src="/static/img/menu-burger.png"  width="227"  height="105"  layout="fixed"  alt="burger menu"></amp-img>

<amp-img class="col-12 md-col-6" src="/static/img/image-library/menu-image-library.png"  width="610"  height="340"  layout="responsive" alt="menu image library"></amp-img>

### Image Field

<amp-img class="col-12 md-col-3" src="/static/img/image-library/inline-image-library.png"  width="361"  height="408" layout="responsive"  alt="inline image library"></amp-img>

Launching the library from the menu makes it appear in a page, while launching it from a field makes it appear in a modal.

## Using the library

There are two main sections in the library: Search and Import

### Search

<amp-img class="col-12 md-col-8" src="/static/img/image-library/search-image-library.png"  width="863"  height="547" layout="responsive"  alt="search image library"></amp-img>

On the left sidenav you can find all your sources which contains images. The first one is "Uploaded" : images that you manually upload thanks to the import.
The others are all your data sources containing an image field.

#### Selecting a source

<amp-img class="col-12 md-col-8" src="/static/img/image-library/filter-image-library.png"  width="1179"  height="618"  layout="responsive"  alt="filter image library"></amp-img>

Once you have a chosen a source, you can then filter and/or sort images from this source to help you find the asset that you need.
If you had launched the image library from a field you can then choose the image that you want, while if you had launched it globally you can only consult them.

Moreover, images uploaded can be deleted.

<amp-img class="col-6 md-col-4" src="/static/img/image-library/choose-image-library.png"  width="342"  height="246"  layout="responsive"  alt="select image"></amp-img>

### Import

In the import tab you can upload your own images. You just have to drag and drop or select from your compute images that you want to upload and then click on the «Import» button.

<amp-img class="col-12 md-col-8" src="/static/img/image-library/import-image-library.png"  width="853"  height="498" layout="responsive"  alt="import image library"></amp-img>

Once the upload is finished a green chip appears on each images that have been correctly uploaded. You can now find and select them on the "Uploaded" source.

## Note about images

The AMP specification requires each image to have an explicit size. Hopefully, you don't have to manually set the width and height on each image, as Ampize will deduce them automatically for you.
