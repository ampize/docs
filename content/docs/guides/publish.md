## How to publish you website?

Once your AMPsite is ready to go live, it's time to publish it.

### Setting your domain name

First you will need to set up a domain name in the "URLS" tab of the site settings.

If you are using AMPize in trial mode, you can only choose a subdomain of .trial.ampize.me, that will automatically be directed to the AMPize servers. Please note that this subdomain is unique and must not be already used by someone else on the platform.

If you are using a paid plan, you can use your own domain name, unless you make sure to point your DNS to the IP address provided under the domain field.

### HTTPS and SSL certificates

Modern web requires security, and communications to every website should be encrypted over HTTPS.
Using HTTPS allows Progressive Web Apps to run and is now a "must have" if you want to get high SEO rankings.

The AMPize.me cloud infrastructure will automatically generate a SSL certificate for your website, so you don't have to care about it. Just provide us your domain name and point it to our servers. We handle the rest.

### AMP validation

By default, AMPize.me prevents publishing of invalid AMP pages by running an internal validation process prior to every site publication action. See the [AMP validation](/docs/guides/ampvalidation) guide for more information.
