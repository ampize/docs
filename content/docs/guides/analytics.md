AMP currently supports a large number of **[analytics vendors](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/analytics/analytics-vendors)**.

Analytics must first be configured in the site settings and can be completed/overridden in page settings.

## Setting up your analytics

Tap the settings menu at site or page level

<amp-img src="/static/img/components/analytics_1.png"  width="850"  height="110"  layout="fixed" alt="settings"></amp-img>

Configure the "Analytics" tab with your vendor type and the appropriate json settings.

### Example for GA

<amp-img src="/static/img/components/analytics_2.png"  width="658"  height="412"  layout="fixed" alt="settings"></amp-img>

Configuration details for each vendor can be found **[here](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/analytics/analytics-vendors)**.
