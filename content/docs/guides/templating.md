<p>AMPize uses Mustache templates to display content from your data sources. Every query-based component (list, detail, carousel) uses them. Together with the CSS code fields in page and site settings they are the main tools to customize the design of your AMPize website</p>
<h2 class="mt4 mb4">Overview</h2>
<p>Mustache templates are simple and easy to use. Being logic-less, they don't have any advanced features such as conditionals and yet they can cover the vast majority of use cases.</p>
<p>AMPize automatically generates basic templates for every use case directly in the query builder so you never need to start from scratch. This makes templating productive as most of the time you can either leave the auto-generated templates as they are ord do some minor tinkering. You can also save your templates and reuse them in other components of the same type and perform centralized updates.</p> 
<h2 class="mt4 mb4">Template management</h2>
<h3 class="mb3 mt3">Using templates in components</h3>
<p>Whenever you use the query builder, the last stage is always a preview of the resulting html. By default, the query builder automatically generates a template adapted to your use case (list, detail or carousel) and uses it to render the preview. This default template lists all the fields from your query in their order of definition. While it may do the job for simple lists of titles or basic content details it might need some tinkering if you want to change the order in which fields are displayed or modify their layout.</p>
<p>Clicking on the pencil-shaped edit button will split the query builder window into two panels : the code editor and the preview. In order to help you code, every change you make in the editor immediately affects the preview. We will cover the details of editing in the next section of this guide.</p>
<p>If at some point during your editing you realize that a field is useless or that you need other fields that aren't in the query you can always go back to the first stage and make the necessary changes. The template will not be re-generated as you return to the last stage unless you click the corresponding button in the second stage.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the template clicking the "SAVE" button in the bottom-right side of the screen will save your changes and close the editor. You can always return and edit the template either by re-opening the query builder ("data" button on the current component toolbar) or going directly to the template editor ("template" button on the current component toolbar). </p>
<h3 class="mb3 mt3">Reusable templates and centralized updates</h3>
<p>In many use cases different components can use the same template and it would be unnecessarily tedious to have to maintain the all separately. This is why templates can be saved and reused in other components. In order to do this simply configure a new component (or edit an existing one) and click the floppy-disk-shaped icon right beneath the code editor. This will display a form which you can use to name and save your template.</p>
<p>Once the template is saved, it can no longer be edited directly from the component. This means that the last stage of the query builder wil no longer display the edit button and code editor and that the "template" button is no longer available on the toolbar of that component. The template can only be edited from the centralized template editing interface.</p>
<p>To access this interface simply click the "Templates" button in the site menu. Reusable templates are scoped by site and are separated into categories depending on what components can use them. Here you can edit or delete the templates. Any changes made to a template in this interface is automatically applied to any components that use it.</p>
<p>In order to use an existing template in a component simply create a new component (or edit an existing one) and select that template in the second stage of the query builder. Keep in mind that this discards the components current custom template (if it has one).</p>
<p>If you don't want a component to use a saved template anymore you can always select another one or "custom template" in the second stage of the query builder. If you select "custom template" you can either re-generate the template automatically by clicking the corresponding button or use the code of the previously selected template as a basis for the code editor.</p>
<h2 class="mt4 mb4">Template code</h2>
<p>This is a basic list template auto-generated by the query builder.</p>
<pre><code>
{{#capitalList}}
 <div>
{{title}}
<a class="ampize-primary-color" href="{{ampizeDetailUrl}}">Read more</a>
<hr></div>
 {{/capitalList}}
 {{#ampizePaging}}
<div class="flex justify-center ampize-paging">
{{#prevPage}}<button class="ampize-btn ampize-btn-secondary"><a href="{{url}}"><<</a></button> {{/prevPage}} 
 <span class="ampize-paging-current-page">{{currentPage}}</span> 
{{#nextPage}} <button class="ampize-btn ampize-btn-secondary"><a href="{{url}}">>></a></button>{{/nextPage}} 
</div>
{{/ampizePaging}}
</code></pre>
<p>It displays the title followed by a "read more" link for each item in the list. As you can see it's just HTML enriched with some Moustache code in order to repeat the div for each item and output the data.</p>
<p>The first part of the code between <code>{{#capitalList}}</code> and <code>{{/capitalList}}</code> is specific to the data and is repeated for each item (capitalList is the internal name of the query). The second part between <code>{{#ampizePaging}}</code> and <code>{{/ampizePaging}}</code> is component-specific code : in this case the paging links that will be displayed under the list if you activate paging in the component settings.</p>
