Notifications and subscribers are website-specific and require a published website. 
In order to configure push notifications on your website simply access it in the Site Builder and open the Site Settings from the left menu. All you need to do is switch on "Enable subscriptions to push notifications". Optionally you can choose a "Notification default icon" which will be added to all notifications you send to subscribers from that website. One you save the changes don't forget to publish your website. Please note that these changes have no effect on the preview : only the live version is affected once the website is published.
Your website now contains a notification subscription icon which will appear in the bottom right corner of any compatible browser. Your users can use this icon to subscribe and unsubscibe from push notifications from your website.
