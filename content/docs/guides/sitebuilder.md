<h2 class="mt4 mb4">Overview</h2>
<p>The site builder allows you to control every single aspect of your website. It handles anything form the general settings of the entire website to the fine tuning the options of a specific component on one of yor pages</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the interface : </p>
<amp-img src="/static/img/site-builder/interface.png"  width="1362"  height="418"  layout="responsive"  alt="site builder interface"></amp-img>
<p>It is comprised of two main panels : the main panel made up of the toolbar and the page editor and the side panel.</p>
<p>The toolbar in the main houses the following features from left to right : </p>
<ul>
<li>The site menu providing access to the following features for the current site : site settings, the centralized template editing interface, the live view button which opens up the current live version of your website (only visible if the website has been published), publishing tools and Github sync tools (if a repository has been configured in site settings) </li>
<li>The current website and current page separated by a chevron. Clicking on either of them can be used to edit the corresponding name</li>
<li>The preview button which launches a preview of the current page.</li>
<li>The page settings button which opens the settings interface for the current page</li>
</ul>
<p>The page editor allows you to edit the general layout of the page by dragging and dropping components as well as resizing them and editing their individual options.</p>
<p>The side panel has two tabs : a "components" tab containing an accordion list of components to add to the current page and a "pages" tab containing the editable page tree </p>
<h2 class="mt4 mb4">Managing the page tree</h2>
<div class="col-6 md-col-3">
    <amp-img src="/static/img/site-builder/tree.png"  width="336"  height="392"  layout="responsive"  alt="page tree"></amp-img>
</div>
<div class="col-12 md-col-8">
	<p>The page tree can be easily managed by drag and drop. Each page has an icon in order to distinguish the homepage, top-level pages and subpages. Moving the pages up and down changes their order in menus. Moving them left an right changes their hierarchy. Simply click on a pages name to select it in the main panel.</p>
	<p>Adding a new page is simple : simply click on the plus button at the bottom of the list in order to add a new top-level page and then move it to the desired place in the tree. You can also add a page directly as a child of a specific page using the right-side menu of that page (appears when hovering above page in tree). This menu can also be used to rename and delete pages.</p>
	<p>Any top-level page can be set to be the homepage from the right-side menu. The current homepage cannot be deleted. When you first open a website in the site builder it wil already have an empty homepage</p>
