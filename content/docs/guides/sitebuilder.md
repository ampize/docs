<h2 class="mt4 mb4">Overview</h2>
<p>The site builder allows you to control every single aspect of your website. It handles anything form the general settings of the entire website to the fine tuning the options of a specific component on one of yor pages</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the interface : </p>
<amp-img src="/static/img/site-builder/interface.png"  width="1362"  height="418"  layout="responsive"  alt="site builder interface"></amp-img>
<p>It is comprised of two main panels : the central panel made up of the toolbar and the page editor and the side panel.</p>
<p>The toolbar in the main houses the following features from left to right : </p>
<ul>
<li>The site menu providing access to the following features for the current site : site settings, the centralized template editing interface, the live view button which opens up the current live version of your website (only visible if the website has been published), publishing tools and Github sync tools (if a repository has been configured in site settings) </li>
<li>The current website and current page separated by a chevron. Clicking on either of them can be used to edit the corresponding name</li>
<li>The preview button which launches a preview of the current page.</li>
<li>The page settings button which opens the settings interface for the current page</li>
</ul>
<p>The page editor allows you to edit the general layout of the page by dragging and dropping components as well as resizing them and editing their individual options.</p>
<p>The side panel has two tabs : a "components" tab containing an accordion list of components to add to the current page and a "pages" tab containing the editable page tree </p>
