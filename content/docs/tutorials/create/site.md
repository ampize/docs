In the previous tutorial, you created your REST API data-source.
The second step is to create a website to display the data.

1. In the hamburger menu, click on the "Site builder" link.
2. Create a new 'Empty Model' Custom website, by clicking on the red plus sign.
3. On the right panel under 'Components' Select 'Navigation' > 'Menu' to add a navigation menu to your website. 

<amp-img src="/static/img/home1.png" width="1444" height="838" layout="responsive" class="screenshot">

4. In left left panel, within the new 'Menu' block, click on the Settings icon to customize the component. For example, you can choose an image from the library to be displayed as a logo.

<amp-img src="/static/img/home2.png" width="1443" height="833" layout="responsive" class="screenshot">
