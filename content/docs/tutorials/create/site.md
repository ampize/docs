In the previous tutorial, we've created a REST API data-source.
The second step is to create a website to display the data.

1. In the hamburger menu, click on the "Site builder" link.
2. Click on the Plus sign to add a new website.
3. On the homepage of the site, click on the "Menu component" in the component library (right column) to add a menu.

<amp-img src="/static/img/home1.png" width="1444" height="838" layout="responsive" class="screenshot">

4. Click on the Settings icon in the toolbar of the block to customize the component. For example, you can choose an image from the library to be displayed as a logo.

<amp-img src="/static/img/home2.png" width="1443" height="833" layout="responsive" class="screenshot">
