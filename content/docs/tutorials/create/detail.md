Now we'll add and configure more pages in our site, including a detail view of the articles.

1. Click on the "Page" tab in the right column.
2. In the action menu of the homepage item, click on "Add a subpage" and give a name to this new page.
3. Repeat this step for each section to build the tree structure of your site.

4. To add a detail view, click on the Plus button and give a name to the page, for example "Article".
5. On this page, add a "Detail" component ("Content" category)
6. As we did before for the List component, we select the structures and the fields we want to be displayed.

<amp-img src="/static/img/detail.png" width="1445" height="839" layout="responsive" class="screenshot">  

7. Select a template model or edit the custom template and save the query.
8. Last step, go back to the homepage, edit the setting of the List component, select the "Article" page we've just created as the target Detail page.
