We can add a few more components to the homepage, for example:

- a YouTube video ("Media" category)
- a Twitter block ("Social")
- and an ad component ("Monetize")

Each component can be resized and moved by drag'n'drop, and has specific properties that can be managed through the "Settings" icon.
For example, for the ad componenant, we can choose among the many available ad networks, and display the ad on a sticky mode at the bottom of the page.
