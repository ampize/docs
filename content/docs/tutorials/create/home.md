You can add components to the homepage as desired, for example:

- In the right panel under 'Components', select 'Media' > 'YouTube'. In the new 'Youtube' block in the left panel select the settings icon to make modification.
- Similarly, under 'Components' > 'Social' > 'Twitter', you can add a Twitter block 
- Under 'Components' > 'Monetize' > 'Ad' you can add an ad component 

Each component can be resized and moved by drag'n'drop, they each have specific properties which can be managed through their respective "Settings" icon, in their component block.
For example, for the ad componenant, we can choose among the many available ad networks, and display the ad on a sticky mode at the bottom of the page.
