              <p>One of the core principles of AMP is to provide a consistently FAST experience to end-users.</p>
              <p>The Google AMP Cache is a one of the key ingredients to deliver a near instant experience.</p>
              <p>This Content Delivery Network is designed to fetch, optimize and serve any valid AMP Content</p>
              <p>with reduced latencies, images and network optimizations.</p>
              <p class="mt2 squaretitle">The AMPize.me architecture integrates deeply with the AMP Cache to provide a fast-loading experience, independantly from the original scaling capabilities of your data-sources.</p>

              <p class="squaretitle">As a result, your data-source is protected by the cache and your site easily scale with incoming traffic</p>
