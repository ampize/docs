              <p>One of the core principles of AMP is to provide a consistently FAST experience to end-users.</p>
              <p>The Google AMP Cache is a one of the key ingredients to delivering a near instant experience.</p>
              <p>This Content Delivery Network is designed to collect, optimize and serve any valid AMP Content</p>
              <p>with reduced latencies, and with image and network optimizations.</p>
              <p class="mt2 squaretitle">The AMPize.me architecture integrates deeply with the AMP Cache to provide a fast-loading experience, independant from the original scaling capabilities of your data-sources.</p>

                <li class="mb2">Existing contents are directly served from the AMP Cache</li>
                <li class="mb2">The AMP Cache gets automatically updated, every 15 seconds from the original data-source. (Auto-Update time-frames will evolve over time.)</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="squaretitle">As a result, your AMP website will be easily scalable, and able to handle all of the incoming traffic while your original data-source will be protected by the AMP Cache.</p>
